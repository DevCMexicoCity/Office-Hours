# Code-of-Conduct

This is a Code of Conduct for the DevC Mexico City community. This is [largely based on the p5.js Code of Conduct](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and applies to all interactions here on GitHub, Discord, YouTube comments, and YouTube chat.

* **Be mindful of your language.** Any of the following behavior is unacceptable: 
  * Offensive comments related to gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, language, neuro-type, size, ability, class, religion, culture, subculture, political opinion, age, skill level, occupation, or background
  * Threats of violence
  * Deliberate intimidation
  * Sexually explicit or violent material
  * Unwelcome sexual attention
  * Stalking or following
  * Or any other kinds of harassment

  Use your best judgement. If it will possibly make others uncomfortable, do not post it.

* **Be respectful.** Disagreement is not an opportunity to attack someone else's thoughts or opinions. Although views may differ, remember to approach every situation with patience and care. 
* **Be considerate.** Think about how your contribution will affect others in the community. 
* **Be open minded.** Embrace new people and new ideas. Our community is continually evolving and we welcome positive change.

If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, we ask that you report it by emailing [cdmx.devc@gmail.com](mailto:cdmx.devc@gmail.com). Please include your name and a description of the incident, and we will get back to you ASAP.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the DevC Mexico City may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from all Coding Train spaces and identification of the participant as a harasser to other DevC Mexico City members or the general public.
